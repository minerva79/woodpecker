`woodpecker` is a repository of scripts which I have worked on from :fallen_leaf: miscellaneous tasks :fallen_leaf:.

Directories are primarily classified based on the language they were written in:

* ps: Microsoft Powershell
* py: Python
* r: R-Script

Scripts and data blogged at [Minerva's Alcove](https://minerva79.github.io) are also kept here for easy access.

If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me at :email: [adamquek79@gmail.com](mailto:adamquek79@gmail.com)
